In Java, consistent and meaningful naming conventions are important for readability and maintainability. Here are the common Java naming conventions:

1.  Class Names:

- Convention : Use PascalCase (also called UpperCamelCase) for class names.
- Examples : Employee , CustomerOrder , DataManager

2.  Method Names:

- Convention : Use camelCase for method names. Methods should be verbs or verb phrases.
- Examples : getEmployee() , calculateTotalPrice() , printReport()

3.  Variable Names:

- Convention : Use camelCase for variables. Variable names should be nouns or noun phrases.
- Examples : employeeName , totalAmount , orderList

4.  Constant Names:

- Convention : Use all uppercase letters with underscores separating words.
- Examples : MAX_VALUE , PI , DEFAULT_TIMEOUT

5.  Package Names:

- Convention : Use all lowercase letters, and when multiple words are used, separate them with dots. The names are typically written in reverse domain name notation.
- Examples : com.company.project , org.example.utils

6.  Interface Names:

- Convention : Use PascalCase, like classes, often prefixed with "I" or written as descriptive nouns.
- Examples : List , Runnable , IEmployee

7.  Enum Names:

- Convention : Use PascalCase for the enum name and all uppercase letters for enum constants.
- Examples : DayOfWeek , ERROR_CODE , SUCCESS_STATUS

8.  Annotations:

- Convention : Use PascalCase for custom annotation names.
- Examples : @Override , @Controller , @RequestMapping
