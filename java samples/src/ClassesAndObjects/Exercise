Exercise: Build a Simple "Bank Account" Application
You’ll create a Java application that models a simple bank account. The goal is to understand how to:

Use constructors to initialize objects.
Create objects from classes.
Use methods to perform actions on the object’s data.
Requirements:
Create a BankAccount class with the following fields:

accountNumber (String)
accountHolderName (String)
balance (double)
Add Constructors:

A constructor to initialize the account with accountNumber and accountHolderName (balance should be initialized to 0).
A constructor that initializes the account with accountNumber, accountHolderName, and an initial balance.
Add Methods:

deposit(double amount) – adds money to the account.
withdraw(double amount) – withdraws money from the account if there are sufficient funds; otherwise, prints an error message.
displayAccountInfo() – prints the account details: account number, holder name, and current balance.
Create a Main Class:

Create multiple bank account objects.
Test the deposit and withdraw methods.
Display account information after each operation.
